# Colorful Bot for Telegram

I started this project because I wanted to do some programming focused on creating and analazying photos with Python, but soon I realized
it had enough functionality to make a bot out of it.

So, in this repository there is a main Python file with all the classes that the bot uses, and then there is a folder with the source
code of the bot, and the classes I created saved in independent .py files.

Example of the images in can create:

<p align = "center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ismaelestalayo/ColorPalette/blob/master/randomPalette2.jpg?raw=true" width = "60%"/>
</p>

<p align = "center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ismaelestalayo/ColorPalette/blob/master/randomGradient2.jpg?raw=true" width = "50%"/>
</p>
